# Sign-Language-Detection-python

Sign language detector with Python, OpenCV and Mediapipe !

# Abstract
This project discusses the development of a robust sign language recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the Pre-Trained SSD MobileNet V2 architecture. Trained on a custom dataset, the system achieves an accuracy of 70-80% in recognizing signs in uncontrolled environments with varying light conditions, enhancing communication for the deaf community and aiding sign language learners

### Objectives

1. Develop an accurate real-time Sign Language Recognition System.
2. Create a user-friendly interface for educators and students.
3. Improve system accuracy through machine learning.
4. Ensure integration with existing educational platforms.
5. Validate effectiveness through testing.
6. Provide training for educators.
7. Gather feedback for continuous improvement.
8. Promote adoption for inclusive education.
9. Address ethical considerations.
10. Establish long-term sustainability.

### Applications

The platform's applications include inclusive learning environments, accessible education for remote areas, personalized support services, enhanced communication in public spaces, skills enhancement for educators and professionals, accessible multimedia materials, inclusion in the workforce, tailored education for unique needs, research advancements, and global inclusivity.

## Data Collection & Analysis

### Data Details

The project involved collecting a diverse dataset of sign language gestures, annotating and labeling the dataset with corresponding meanings, preprocessing and extracting features, training machine learning models, evaluating performance metrics, conducting error analysis, and refining the models iteratively.
